3. **Filter Absentees** → Filters out students who are marked **Absent**.
4. **Split Students** → Splits the list of absentees into individual items for processing.
5. **Send SMS** → Sends a customized **SMS alert** to each absentee’s parent/guardian.
6. **Get Row(s) in Sheet** → Reads and logs student details for reference or reporting.
